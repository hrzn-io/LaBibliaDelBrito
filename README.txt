for the first 16 :
n = number of rows and columns
x, y = start position 

there are 4 possible start position for both straight lines and curved lines :
- 0, 0
- 0, n
- n, 0 
- n, n

for every start position there are 2 possible direction for both straight lines and curved lines :
- 0, 0 : south | east
- 0, n : south | west
- n, 0 : north | east
- n, n : north | west

for straight lines when n is reached for either rows or columns, direction change perpendicularly and alternates



for curved lines when n is reached for either rows or columns, direction change and alternate between to direction patterns
